# WetherFriend
WetherFriend - weather monitoring software with voice input capability.
WeatherFriend will tell you about the weather and tell you how to dress for walks, and also tell you about the current time or date.


All you have to do is say "погода друг"  and they themselves will tell you what the weather is outside now

You also have the opportunity to find out the time saying “Время” or the date saying “Дата”

In order to change the city say "Сменить город"

To change the unit "Сменить единице измерения"

Well, to exit, just say "Погода друг пока" or "пока"
